My midterm project is focused on option #2. Using a list, in python, I created a route called "/books" inside my Flask application. Each element in the list is an object of a book with the attributes of the book title and author. I created a book class and create these instances from that class. There is also homepage that leads to the books webpage (the /books route) and each book in the list is displayed along with its respective title, author, and an image of the book cover.
